# Hello-World
Learning How To Use Git and Github For the First Time.

With An Mechanical with Control Engineering and Quantum Physics Background, plus a fascination for coding among other stuff, I came across git and Github during my web development course. But I never understood it or paid enough attention till I got this new challenge, which is learning flutter for app programming.
So this is simply a way for me to learn how to use git/github utilization for different projects. 
Git and Github is a truely great idea!

So there are friends who say hello and there are foes who say war!
